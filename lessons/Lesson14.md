If you're interested in grid systems or you do a lot of work laying out reports or websites, I highly recommend the book [Making and Breaking the Grid](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Breaking-Grid-Graphic-Workshop/dp/1592531253) by Timothy Samara.

[This article](https://www.designsystems.com/space-grids-and-layouts/) contains a lot of extra info on spacing and is largely focused on web design, but it includes some great info on grids and responsive design.
