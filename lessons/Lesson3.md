You can see even more chart types at
[data-to-viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/). Here you can see which chart types
will work for different types of data, read about potential pitfalls, and also
get example R code for how to make each chart type. I encourage you to refer to
this resource throughout the course any time you need to make a new chart and
are looking for a starting point.
